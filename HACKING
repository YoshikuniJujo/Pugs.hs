== Becoming a Pugs Hacker

0) Join #perl6 on irc.freenode.net

1) Ask for a commit bit

2) Clone Pugs.hs from the perl6 organization on GitHub.

    git clone git@github.com:perl6/Pugs.hs.git

3) Follow INSTALL instructions to get deps installed

Or follow debian instructions for bleeding edge GHC below!

4) Hack hack hack!

5) Compile

    cd Pugs/
    make            # builds ./pugs executable
    make install    # installs ./pugs as pugs and perl6 executables

6) What was the big deal?

== Installing the latest GHC on a Debian system

The current GHC (7.2.1) has some growing pains, but follow these instructions
and you should be fine:

    # Choose 32bit or 64bit
    GHC=ghc-7.2.1-i386-unknown-linux.tar.bz2
    GHC=ghc-7.2.1-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.bz2

    curl -O http://www.haskell.org/ghc/dist/7.2.1/$GHC
    tar -xjvf $GHC
    cd ghc-7.2.1
    ./configure
    sudo make install
    cd -
    curl -O http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/cabal-install/0.10.2/cabal-install-0.10.2.tar.gz
    tar -xzvf cabal-install-0.10.2.tar.gz
    cd cabal-install-0.10.2
    curl -O http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/raw-attachment/ticket/872/ghc7.diff
    patch -p0 cabal-install.cabal ghc7.diff
    sh bootstrap.sh
    export PATH=$HOME/.cabal/bin:$PATH
    cabal update
    cabal install Pugs

This was cobbled together from:

    http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download_ghc_7_2_1
    http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/CabalInstall
    https://gist.github.com/1169332

== Running the spec tests

    perl t/run_spectests

This will checkout a copy of the spectest suite, and run all the known
to pass tests (list in t/spectest.data). This assumes you've got a copy of
pugs built as

    Pugs/pugs

To get a per-synopsis summary, run:

    perl t/spec/test_summary pugs

This requires a ./perl6 script containing:

    #!/bin/sh
    LC_ALL=en_US.ISO-8859-1 PUGS_USE_EXTERNAL_TEST=1 ./Pugs/pugs -IPugs/ext/Test/lib $*
